This is a blog post about how I am feeling today as usual.

Morning
======

This morning I woke up with a pounding headache. Two days ago I had a shirley temple at my neighbor's backyard cookout and I am still reeling from the consequences. I don't know why I had the shirley temple, especially given my family history of substance abuse problems. Maybe I just wanted to fit in so I would be invited to more cookouts. I think I am going to go to the store and get some baby formula. That always makes me feel better. 

Afternoon 
======

Why is it that I only post updates when I have a physical ailment? Why I am I so fucking negative...
