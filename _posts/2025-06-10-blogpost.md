This is another post about how I am feeling today

Morning 
======

Today I woke up with a pounding headache. Two days ago I had a shirley temple at my neighbor's backyard cookout and I have been reeling from it ever since. I don't know why I had the shirley temple with my family history of substance abuse and all. Maybe I just wanted to fit in so they would invite me over more. I think I am going to go to the store and buy some baby formula now. That always makes me feel better. 

Afternoon
======

Why do I only post updates when I have physical ailments? Why am I so fucking negative???
